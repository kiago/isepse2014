<p>Extraction from YELP</p>
<div>
First of all, we need to get the data from yelp. There is a bash script inside extraction folder, execute yelp.sh will download 10 pages from yelp, including the most rating 100 restaurants. Then the script will parse the html file and save the restaurant name, rating and address into extraction/result file. After downloading 10 pages, the script further downloads 100 images link and caption for each restaurant. In total there will be 10000 images store into the extraction/result file.

<p>GUI Interface</p>

I have written the GUI interface using PHP. The pages will show you which restaurants are in database and you can view more details, let say food images of a restaurant by clicking "view button" for each restaurant. The main page is index.php.
