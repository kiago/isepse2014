#Q1
#how to recover the title bar after shut down the system without closing chromium?
#test 1: erase the cache and the restart the system
$ rm .cache/sessions/*
#result 1: it didn't work 

#a sencond hit
$ sudo metacity --replace
#result 2: nothing happens

#a third try...
$ xfwm4
#result: finally the bar is loaded ^ ^ this cmd starts the bar~

#Q2 
#how find out the most used commands?
#solution:
#To see the mid-term output of each step, I save them as .txt documents.
#But as the last output is the next input, we could use a pipe (|).

#step 1: get the history 
$ history > history.txt 

#step 2: remove the line numbers
$ sed -i "s/^ *[0-9]* //g" history.txt 

#step 3.1: try to sort... 
$ sort history.txt  > history_sorted.txt
#ooooops, this only sort them by their initial letters...
#step 3.2: prefix lines by the number of occurrences
$ uniq -c history_sorted.txt  > history_sorted_uniqc.txt

#step 4: sort them by the value of the prefix number
$ sort -rn history_sorted_uniqc.txt > history_sorted_uniqc_sortrn.txt
#Voila,it seems that the commands most used are ls and cd XD
#However, as many commands takes differernt arguments, such as man, help, git add, tar, mkdir, apt-get, 
#javac, gcc, sublime-text, chmod/chown... this result is not so persuadable :(
